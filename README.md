# Lenme Task    

- ## Use case
One of Lenmeâ€™s borrowers submitted a loan request for $5,000 to pay them back in 6 months. They received an offer from one of the investors on the platform with a 15% Annual Interest Rate. A $3.00 Lenme fee will be added to the total loan amount to be paid by the investor.

- ## Requirements:
    - You are required to develop a Django REST project to be able to build the following flow-through its APIs;
    - The borrower submits a loan request for $5,000 `loan amount` and 6 months `loan period`
    - The investor will submit an offer to the borrower with 15% `Annual Interest Rate`
    - The borrower will accept the offer
    - Check if the investor has sufficient balance in their account to fund the `Total Loan Amount` (Loan Amount + Lenme Fee)
    - The loan will be funded successfully and the loan status will be `Funded`
    - Six monthly payments will be scheduled from the day the loan was funded successfully (Note: Developing an external scheduler is not required)
    - Once all the payments are successfully paid back to the investor, the loan status will be changed to `Completed`

## Installation

First you have to clone the project the navigate to lenme folder and run the following commands:
```bash
  pipenv install
  pipenv shell
  pip install -r requirments.txt
```

The you have to open Three terminals and make sure that pipenv is activated
```bash
pipenv shell
```

First terminal we will run DRF server as follows:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Second terminal we will start Celery worker to start our Tasks Queue using the following command:
```bash
celery -A lenme worker -l debug
```
Third terminal we will start celery beat to get the scheduled periodic tasks as follows:
```bash
celery -A lenme beat -l debug
```
